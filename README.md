# CDPHE Pipelines
The pipelines included in this repository are meant to be used for identification, characterization, and quality assessment of bacterial short read sequencing.  The pipelines themselves have been designed to accomodate fastq files coming from Illumina instruments, as well as fastq files which can be downloaded from NCBI's SRA database.  Previous versions of the pipelines were designed for specific virtual machines designed on the Google cloud platform, but we are actively trying to adapt the current versions to be platform agnostic.  

## INSTALLATION
